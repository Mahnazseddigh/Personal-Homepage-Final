<h1 class="ttl1"> About me </h1>
<p> I am a woman and living in north Manchester. I'm living in the UK from 2014 but I'm originally from Iran. I have gone through so many different experiences since I'm in the UK; I worked in different places like restaurant, working as a private Math and Physics tutor and now part time in school as a teacher assistant. Honest speaking none of them yet met my demands and goals as a job, but with CYF, I feel so delighted so far when I'm working on our homeworks. I feel so concentrated and don't feel passing of time, when I'm coding and I can imagine how prosperous I will feel when I become a proffesioal software developer hopefully!
I love people and helping them, love to study, work, earn money and travel all over the world. </p>

  <h1 class="ttl1"> My hobbies </h1>
I love seeing the world with my friends or family, I like to earn a fortune salary and help young people who are in need for their education. I play setar (an Iranian instrument) and started learning piano. 
And finally I love to code and my goal is to be one of the best software developer!
